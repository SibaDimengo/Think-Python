Think-Python
============

Code examples and exercise solutions from Think Python by Allen Downey, published by O'Reilly Media.

## Usage
`git clone` this repository into a directory.  You'll then be able to run programs by typing `python <filename>`.

Many of these examples require a library that Allen Downey has written called Swampy.  You can find that [here](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/swampy/)

To use this material in a classroom setting, we recommend forking the repo and customizing the code and file names to fit your objectives.  For instance, you might select PokerHand.py, title it assignment1.py, modify it for your purposes, etc.  Your students can then `git clone` your custom repository to get your assignments without getting any superfluous content.  Note that students may be able to locate solutions to these problems in this repo :)
